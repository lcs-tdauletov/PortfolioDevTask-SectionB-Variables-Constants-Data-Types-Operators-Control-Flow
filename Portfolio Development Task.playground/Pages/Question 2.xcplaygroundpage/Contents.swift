 # Question 2
 
 Fascinated by the snowfall at Lakefield College School, you resolve to write an augmented-reality app that will use a phone's camera, and time-lapse photography, to track snowfall amounts for each day.
 
 ![snowfallatlcs](snowfallatlcs.png "Having fun with snow at LCS")
 
 The following pieces of information will be tracked each hour:
 
 * date of this measurement
 * time of this measurement
 * current height of snow outside window in centimetres
 
 Additionally, the app will keep track of, overall:
 
 * total snowfall over entire year so far
 
 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.

// Answer question 2 below
let dateOfThisMeasurement = "December, 19, 2017."
print("This measurement stays concrete and is only applicable for this very date. Therefore, it should be a constant")
let timeOfThisMeasurement = "1:30 p.m."
print("This measurement, too, was only done once and will never repeat itself in history. Therefore, it should be a constant.")
let currentHeightOfSnowOutsideInCentimeters = 20
print("Under the given circumstances, at this date and this time, there is only going to be one height of snow. Therefore, it should be a constant")
var totalSnowfallOverTheEntireYearSoFar = 21
print("Depending on the time period when it is measured, the total amount of snow will vary throughout the year. Therefore, it should be a variable.")
